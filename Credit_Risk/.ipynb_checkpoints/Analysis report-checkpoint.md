Overview:
This report is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model when forecasting credit risk and mainly to identify healthy loans (0) vs high-risk loans (1). The goal is to see if this can effectively help the company manage their credit risk.

Model Performance:
Accuracy: 99%
The model correctly forecasts 99% of the loan results.

Precision:
Healthy Loans (0): 1.00 (perfect)
High-Risk Loans (1): 0.86 (14% false positives)

Recall:
Healthy Loans (0): 1.00 (captures all healthy loans)
High-Risk Loans (1): 0.91 (misses 9% of high-risk loans)

Summary and Recommendation:
The logistic regression model shows high accuracy and is especially strong in finding out healthy loans. When it effectively finds a majority of high-risk loans, the slightly lower precision gives some misclassifications.

Recommendation: The model can be recommended for use, especially to prevent misclassification of healthy loans. However, the company should monitor its effectiveness in identifying high-risk loans and find out more measures to improve performance in that area.
